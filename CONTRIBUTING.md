# Contributing to Brand Playbook Intelligence

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Process

### Setting up your development environment

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Set up the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install pytest pytest-asyncio httpx  # For testing
   ```

3. Set up the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Running tests

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/ -v
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run type-check
npm run lint
```

### Code Style

**Python (Backend):**
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints where possible
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small

**TypeScript (Frontend):**
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and reusable

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` A new feature
- `fix:` A bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Changes that don't affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor:` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` A code change that improves performance
- `test:` Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Example: `feat: add PDF table extraction support`

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/tom2tomtomtom/Playbook/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/tom2tomtomtom/Playbook/issues/new); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We love feature requests! Please open an issue and describe:

- The problem you're trying to solve
- How you envision the solution
- Any alternatives you've considered
